Role-specific passwords:
Executive: EXEC_PASS
Member: MEM_PASS

Dummy account credentials:
username, password: bgil, bgil
username, password: bloi, bloi


Admin credentials:
username: admin
password: gailangadmin@123


TO DO:
Overall:
1. Any deletion is still not working (ang ako na figure out ra nga method is soft deleting, meaning dili mawala sa database ang account pero dili lang siya ma gamit for login)
2. Deletion Request buttons dont work for both admin and executive

Admin:
1. View system logs fails.
2. Edit button needs rework. Not clear which row it is editing.
3. Should not be able to edit self in manage users.

Executive:
1. If they have made a deletion request, their username should not appear in their deletion requests table
2. add view inactive users
3. manage user profile should have search function. and be put in main area


BUGS:
1. Editing own username in manage users, bug.
2. Manage users in general is a bug fest.
